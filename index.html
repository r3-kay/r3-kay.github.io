        <h1>Game Level Design</h1>
        <h2>What the role entails:</h2>
        <p> When you play games, think about what keeps you wanting to play more. Is it the environment? 
            The way the character interacts with the world around it? Think about what makes a game 
            interesting and exciting to play.
            This is the job of a level designer. 
            <br> The process begins by sketching ideas out and thinking about how to best approach the 
            level in terms of how the player could act, and all the possibilties of this. The game needs 
            to flow well, with a clear path mapped out but one that is not forcing the player through a narrow 
            path that will inevitably become boring. They need to think about how to get the player to 
            intuitively trigger the events that allows the game to progress, without making it too easy or too
            obscure. 
            <br><br> <b>A level designer should:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>be able to come up with creative ways of adding missions and challenges
                to a game.</li>
                <li>have a good understanding of gameplay mechanics and be able to see all possibilities
                    in terms of what the player could do, even when acting unpredictably.  </li>
                <li>be able to use scripting languages and understand the basics of gameplay programming.</li>
                <li>have a basic understanding of physics and be able to accurately predict how objects
                     will move within the game when the laws of physics are applied.</li>
                <li>have developed 2D and 3D design skills and be able to use software such as Maya to create
                     3D environments.</li>
                <li>be able to communicate well with other areas of the team such as the artists and design team.
                     They will most likely work alongside the gameplay designers, gameplay testers, as well as the
                      artists and programmers.</li>
            </ul>         
        </p>
        <h2><i>So how do I become a level designer?</i></h2>
        <p>If you are at school or in college, taking the following courses could be useful in landing you

        <h2><i>But what if I've already finished college?</i></h2>
        <p>If you've finished college in a different field, then don't fret, you can still develop the skills to 
            break into the level design career. <br><br>
            There are many ways to approach becoming a level designer, but the best place to start would probably
            be to <b>play games!</b> Think about the types of games you would be interested in creating, and while playing 
            these games, pay attention to the layout of each area and how you as the user interacts with the surrounding
            environment. Becoming conscious of these things means that you are more likely to get a better understanding 
            of how the level design process works and everything that you need to keep in mind when creating a level.
            <br><br>
            <b>Buildling a portfolio</b> will be particularly useful as this is where you are able to showcase your work. 
            For most job applications, this will be essential. It is the most optimal way of letting your employer know what 
            you are capable of producing. 
            <br><br>
            Some game publishers create software that allows you to create your own mods. <b>Modding</b> is a 
            great way to practice your skills, as you can make changes to practically any aspect of the game. You 
            can make mods to change how the game looks, but also how it plays. This means you could potentially create 
            a complete overhaul of the game. As well as being a great way of practicing, you could also create an area within 
            your portfolio where you can showcase these mods.
